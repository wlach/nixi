# About

This is the source to the "nixi" website, which aims to offer a better web-based
user interface to bike share systems across the world.

# Development

If you want to develop/test nixi offline, you can do so by checking out a copy
of this repository and loading the "index.html" file in your web browser. Note
that Chrome refuses to generate marker images locally for some reason that I
haven't determined yet (everything works fine in Firefox). You can work around
this by using a simple web server to serve the content.
